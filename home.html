                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <p>I am a second-year student in Social Administration Department at City University of Hong Kong.  I expect to receive the Bachelor degree in the summer of 2010. I decided when I was young to work in a welfare organization so I can help people as much as I can. After studying for one year at CityU, I found myself a grown-up. I learned to care more about other people, and share with them my own stories and experiences. More importantly, I found my decision to be enrolled in thsi program could not be wiser. My professors made my learning enjoyable and fruitable. I like the class discussions and group work so I can train my presentatin and communication abilities and get to know how to work with other people. The classmates and teachers are really friendly.  Last month,  I got the opportunity to study at at the University of Strathclyde in Glasgow, UK, for one semester through the exchange programme. It was one of the most enriching learning experiences in my undergraduate education so far!</p>

                <h3>Values & Beliefs</h3>
                <p>"It is more blessed to give than to receive". I am strong believer to this belief because when we give a part of ourselves to help others, the world will become a much better place.I used to go to visit and talk to the elderly, some of whom are severely handicapped. It is most rewarding to see a smile on their faces at the end of the day. Even though sometimes I may feel frustrated when dealing with some difficult issues, I am still learning and trying my best to help them.</p>

                <h3>Career Aspirations</h3>
                <p>My career aspirations are to find a motivating place of work, a place where I could use my knowledge, skills and abilities and improve. I want to work in a welfare organization so that I have the opportunity to help others. e.g., Hong Kong Council of Social Service, Social Welfare Department in HKSAR, Hong Kong Family Welfare Society.</p>
