I have met a lot of friends and learned a lot from my study at the Department of Government. Although I only stay there for one semester, I will never forget the happiness as an exchange student in UK. I have wonderful impression on University of Strathclyde. It provides good environment for international students and people there are very friendly. During the orientation, the international students learned about campus life, community nearby, and graduate study. Each international student had great time and was more familiar with the university.</li>

She would love to help everyone in need of help even she is just such a tiny person. Her English was not excellent at the beginning, and I often ran into her on her way to the library. I believe she must have studied very hard as her English as well as her course performance are quite impressive! <span>(Comments from Prof. Hales, Leader of Internatinal Group)</span></li>

This includes selling products to visitors, handling enquires, arranging permits for visitors, handling tour bookings using the online booking system and compiling statistical reports. I was pretty much occupied while at work, but it was a lot of fun. My communication capabilities (both in English and Cantonese) and multiple-task ability was greatly improved. As I did not have much background in conservation, I managed to read more information in my spare time to make sure the information I give out is accurate and correct. My supervisor and colleagues were all impressed by my work performance.</li>

She would love to help everyone in need of help even she is just such a tiny person. She brought a lot of enthusiam and energy to my office! People were affected by this obviously. She never complained and on the country she always checked with me if there was anything extra she can do. I am very glad to have her in my office.
