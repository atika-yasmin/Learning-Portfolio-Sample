                    <p>The purpose of my portfolio is to track my learning and development throughout my undergraduate years. My portfolio is a collection and reflection of my experiences to get myself a clearer picture of my growth. </p>

                        <article class="">
                            <p>Being aligned with the <span>Intended Learning Outcomes of my program</span>, I hope to improve my critical thinking ability. I believe, regardless the field, we need to be able to think critically in terms of evaluating what is observed or expressed. I will apply this to my major study as well as my own learning and development at a higher level. I will be reflective on my own development by assessing it critically. The reflective judgment will help me to improve in the long run.

                        <article class="">
                            <p>The other goal I have is to improve my communication capability. In Social Administration, we need to communicate effectively with different people. So I want to be able to communicate both orally and in writing in a way that is well organized, topical and effective.</p>

                        <p>I have achieved different things in the past years in different areas:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>I was awarded CityU A+++ entrance Scholarship</li>
                            <li>I was recognized as top 5 student in my programme</li>
                            <li>I was elected to be in the Student Union</li>
                            <li>I was exchanged to University of Strathclyde in Glasgow, UK for one semester</li>
                        </ul>

                    <h3>Reflection and Action Plan</h3>
                    <article class="">
                        <p>In the past one year and a half, I benefited a lot from setting up action plans to fulfill my personal goals. My university life has been memorable but quite busy. However, I deem this as a good thing, which give me opportunities to further develop myself in different aspects. Now I am ready to look for a job to start my professional career.I am confident that my academic performance as well as my experiences in other areas will help me stand out!</p>

                    <article class="">
                        <p>I took the LASSI at the beginning of my second year. In some aspects I became better, but mostly stayed the same on the rest aspects. Surprisingly, my concentration score dropped 10%. I think my participation in the extra-curricular activities this year might distract me from my study a bit. <a href="">Here is my LASSI report.</a></p>
